New issues found in existing system:
=======================================
1) Customer Part -> when edited doesn't show appropraite UOM value. --> http://localhost/bsp-gsthero/customer_part/59
2) Customer Part -> Part Price page renders very slowly 	--> http://localhost/bsp-gsthero/customer_part_price/59http://localhost/bsp-gsthero/customer_part_price/59
3) Customer Part -> Part price page once new item is added it renders some intermediate page and then redirect to Customer Part Price page which is slow too.
4) http://localhost/bsp-gsthero/view_customer_tracking_id/29 --> Customer value is not shown
